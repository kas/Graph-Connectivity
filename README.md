# Introduction
I was tasked to create a program that would determine if a graph was connected for my final project in my Discrete Math class (Spring 2016). I decided to use Python 3 and the libraries NumPy and NetworkX. These two libraries aided me in converting adjacency matrices into graphs and interacting with those graphs.

I received a 100% on the project.
